# Compressor
This is a very simple program that takes an image and converts it to a jpg with a specified quality.

## How to use
This is a command line program so call it from there. There are two arguments, the path to an image and the target output quality. The output quality is a number between 1 and 100. When it is done the program will output to a file called `out.png`. A call could look like this:

`compressor.exe "C:/path/to/image.png" 10`
